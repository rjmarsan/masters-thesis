\section{Tembo: A CDDS Key-Value Store}
\label{sec:kv}

We created Tembo, a CDDS Key-Value (KV) store, to evaluate the
effectiveness of a CDDS-based data store.  The system involves the
integration of the CDDS-based B-Tree described in
Chapter~\ref{sec:cdds_btree} into Redis~\citep{Redis}, a widely used
event-driven KV store.  As our contribution is not based around the
design of this KV system, we only briefly describe Tembo in this
section.  As shown in Chapter~\ref{sec:impl_effort}, the integration
effort was minor and leads us to believe that retrofitting CDDS into
existing applications will be straightforward.


The base architecture of Redis is well suited for a CDDS as it retains
the entire data set in RAM\@.  This also allows an unmodified Redis to
serve as an appropriate performance baseline.  While persistence in
the original system was provided by a write-ahead append-only log,
this is eliminated in Tembo because of the CDDS B-Tree integration.
For fault-tolerance, Tembo provides master-slave replication with
support for hierarchical replication trees where a slave can act as
the master for other replicas.  Consistent hashing~\citep{Karger97} is
used by client libraries to distribute data in a Tembo cluster.
