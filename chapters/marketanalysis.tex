\chapter{Market Analysis}
\label{sec:market}

In order to evaluate AndroMEDA effectiveness in identifying malware, it's important to evaluate the ability to identify malware without it. As previously discussed in \ref{sec:permissions}, Permissions are the single security measure that defends an Android user from malicious software. We hope to show a fundamental disconnect between Permissions and UAA, as conclusive evidence that Permissions should not be the sole security system on Android. In order to study this, we must examine the how Permissions reflect app behavior, and if known malware can be identified with Permissions alone.

\section{Market Dataset}
To do a broad scale study of Android permissions, we introduce a novel dataset: \temp{AndroidMarketDB}. \temp{AndroidMarketDB} contains metadata from \temp{80\%} of all known Android Apps in the GPStore, see Table \ref{tab:marketstats}. This metadata, described in \ref{tab:marketmetadata}, is rich in contextual information about an app. For a period of 1 month in May-June 2012, the GPStore was scanned twice a day. This dataset provides detailed metadata for all areas of the Android market, not just the top percent. Despite the large amount of metadata available, we will focus on the Permissions, leaving most other fields for Future Work\ref{sec:futurework}.

% Should have some figures demonstrating how big this dataset is.

\section{Global Permission Analysis}
We first look at the global trends of Permissions in the GPStore. Ideally, we find that access to sensitive PII, and dangerous operations, only is requested by a handful of apps that truly need them. This both increases the user's ability to understand how an app behaves, increases the user's trust in the Permission system, and demonstrates a strong connection between Permission Fingerprint and User-App Agreement. Ultimately, however, we expect to find a system that falls short of these goals.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=1.0\columnwidth]{figs/AllPermissions_Tail}
\caption{Less commonly used permissions in the GPStore}
\label{fig:tailpermissions}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:allpermissions} shows all major permissions in the GPStore, sorted by frequency of use. This graph highlights several things: First off, \textit{INTERNET} is a dominant permission, with well over half of the GPStore apps requesting it. The next 5 permissions, \textit{Write to Storage}, \textit{Reading Phone Info}, \textit{Location Info} and \textit{Wake Lock}, all have over 50,000 apps that request them. A steep drop is seen for \textit{Read Contacts}, \textit{Call Phones}, and \textit{Camera}, with around 25,000 apps each. Of these top 9, 3 provide access to semi-personal information: \textit{Reading Phone Info} and the \textit{Location Info} permissions. It's only when we get to the lower 3 do we get access to personal information. 

Figure \ref{fig:tailpermissions} examines the tail permissions in the GPStore. This section contains the bulk of permissions related to PII, with \textit{Record Audio}, \textit{Read Calendar}, \textit{Read SMS}, and so on. It additionally contains many sensitive operations, like \textit{Send SMS} and \textit{System Alert} - which allows apps to draw windows over other apps. These permissions, while being a relatively small portion of the GPStore, still occupy a substantial portion. Indeed, with every dangerous permission, many legitimate use cases can be established, see Figure \ref{tab:permissionsanduses} for examples.

\begin{table*}[h]
\begin{small}
\begin{tabular}{p{3cm}|p{12.5cm}}
Permission & Use Case \\
\hline

\textit{Location (Fine)} & This one has a wide variety of uses, from location-specific news apps and games, to social networks. It's also used by ad networks included in many apps.  \\
\textit{Location (Coarse)} & This one follows the same trends as \textit{Location (Fine)}, but is skewed towards ad networks.  \\
\textit{Read Contacts} & Any access to the address book at all require this, so communication apps, social networks, or many apps that involve sharing with friends will use this.  \\
\textit{Call Phones} & This one is oddly popular. Many customization apps, especially those that seek to replace stock Android apps, will use this, especially if they are replacing address book or home screen functionalities. Additionally, many communication apps will use this, for obvious reasons.  \\
\textit{Camera} & Any photography app or video camera app will make heavy use of this permission. This functionality is often present in other apps as well, e.g. taking a photo of the user for use as a profile photo  \\
\textit{Write Contacts} & This permission is often used with \textit{Read Contacts}. Many social networking sites and services wish to provide ``contact syncing'' abilities with Android device, which requires having write-access to the Contacts database.  \\
\textit{Record Audio} & Like \textit{Camera}, audio apps and communication apps make heavy use of this.  \\
\textit{Send SMS} & Many apps seek to replace the default SMS app, which would therefore require all of the SMS related permissions.  \\
\textit{System Alert} & This permission protects drawing on the screen, on top of other apps. Many apps are designed to be on the screen at all times, either replacing Android components, or complementing them.  \\

\subsection{Per Market Category}
Overall, we find many PII related permissions are requested a substantial number of times. A number of use cases exist, but it remains to be seen if the apps follow those use cases. To further examine this, we separate the apps in \temp{AndroidMarketDB} into the categories present on the GPStore, and rerun the analysis, seen in Figure \ref{fig:permissionspercategory}.

\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=1.0\columnwidth]{figs/PermissionsforMarketCategory}
\caption{Permissions used, as a fraction of total in that category}
\label{fig:permissionspercategory}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

Immediately, the use cases described in \ref{tab:permissionsanduses} become apparent. A large spike is seen in category \textit{Photography} and \textit{Media \& Video} for permission \textit{Camera}, similarly with \textit{Record Audio}, although it's less visible in \textit{Music \& Audio}. Location data is commonly used in \textit{Weather}, \textit{Transportation} and \textit{Travel}, another use case. \textit{Send SMS} is found predominantly in \textit{Communication} and \textit{Social}, another good sign. \textit{Wake Lock} was found heavily in games, music and media, and communication, but less so in other categories, as would be expected for it's use case.

Ultimately, however, some odd patterns can be observed. Despite \textit{Read Contacts} being popular for apps in \textit{Communication}, \textit{Business} and \textit{Social}, it's also found heavily in the \textit{Brain \& Puzzle} game category. A similar pattern is seen in \textit{Call Phones}; it's predominant category is \textit{Communication}, but it's found in significant amounts in \textit{Medical}, \textit{Shopping}, and \textit{Lifestyle}. We also find a spike in \textit{Get Running Apps} in games that does not appear to be present in other market categories. Perhaps the oddest observation was the extremely large spike of \textit{Read Browser History} and \textit{Write Browser History} found in the \textit{Personalization} category.

\temp{STUDY THESE THINGS AND REPORT WHAT THE HECK IS UP}

Overall, we've noted a number of times when patterns in permissions in the GPStore break our expectations of them - potentially violating them User-App Agreement. These could be detected simply from the Permission Fingerprint. We have shown a fairly strong correlation with major PII permissions and Android categories, but demonstrated many cases where they do not line up, both maliciously and with legitimate use cases.






\section{Malware Dataset}
Next, we compare a malware dataset with \temp{AndroidMarketDB}, in the hopes of finding them as outliers. Ideally, all malicious behavior would show up in the permission fingerprint of an app, so therefore it's unique set of capabilities would stand out in the Google Play Store. Demonstrating that expected behavior and Permission Fingerprint are correlated will be an important part of that. Ultimately, however, we expect this method to have it's shortcomings.

\subsection{Android Malware Genome Project}
The dataset we use - the largest academic set of it's kind, is the Android Malware Genome Project\citep{zhou2012dissecting}, from NCSU. Containing almost 1300 samples from 52 families of actual Android malware, it provides the ideal test dataset for Android. We first classify each malware family by its capabilities, according to data aggregated by Spreitzenbarth\citep{spreitzenbarth2013} and Hackmageddon\citep{hackmageddon2011}, with the chart shown in Figure \ref{fig:malwaredboverview}, and the explanation of the classification of capabilities in Table \ref{tab:malwaredbcategories}.

Of the three classes of malware discussed in \ref{sec:malware}, we observe that very few of the malware families use only one attack vector - 6 families, all of which only used \textit{SMS} attacks, and 1, \textit{Pjapps} used none, only being a botnet. Clearly, Android Malware often uses multiple vectors. We also note that 33 of 52 - 63\% of all malware families upload personal information to a remote server. 

\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=1.0\columnwidth]{figs/MalwareCapabiltiesPermissions}
\caption{Permission Fingerprints of malware with different capabilties, compared to the GPStore total}
\label{fig:malwarefingerprint}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Malware Fingerprints}
The first step in analyzing whether malware Permission Fingerprints are seen as outliers is to obtain permission fingerprints for all apps in the database. After which, we aggregated the fingerprints by classification of capabilities. The result, Figure \ref{fig:malwarefingerprint}, provides a novel look at malware, it's capabilities, and it's permissions relative to the Android market. The differences in Permission Fingerprints, and therefore capabilities of Malware vs the GPStore total become obvious right away. Malware is far more likely to request access to SMS, particularly reading and writing the database, as well as system operations like disabling the lock screen and reading systme logs. 

However, further insight is given when looking at the fingerprints of malware with a specific capability. \textit{Spyware} apps demonstrate this quite clearly: They request access to location, permission to keep the device on at all times, record audio and send SMS messages. These capabilities are what would be expected out of spyware. Likewise, \textit{Premium SMS} apps requested access to Send SMS messages quite often\footnote{The reason this number is not 100\% is because not all variants of a family of malware known to posses a \textit{Premium SMS} exploit may have that capability}. We also observe that \textit{Botnet} malware occasionally accesses system features like disabling the lock screen and reading system logs.

These obversvations are highly valuble, but things break down when we look at the \textit{Info} category. This permission fingerprint, aside from \textit{Read SMS} and \textit{Write SMS}, does not appear significantly different than the GPStore total, especially when considering the Market Category fluctuations observed earlier. 


\section{Popular Apps}
As we have shown, all categories of malware but Info Stealing show profound differences in permission fingerprints: they are far more likely to access unusual permissions than normal Android apps. However, Info stealing apps did not show such anomalies, making them far easier to hide inside of benign apps - a technique malware writers already use\citep{avastfakeapps}. Thus, if more popular apps have more access to PII, this vector poses a serious threat.

For starters, we note that the metadata in \temp{AndroidMarketDB} isn't accuratekjlsadgkasdg. we first analyze the most popular apps in the entire Google Play Store.

% - we find this to be a popular trend, as documented by Avast!\citep{avastfakeapps}, when they found several knock-offs of popular Android apps in the GPStore that send premium SMS messages and personal info. It is th
