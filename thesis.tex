%% Create an abstract that can also be used for the ProQuest abstract.

\begin{abstract}
The tremendous rise of mobile computing has led to an equally strong rise in mobile malware. Android, the predominant mobile OS, uses a Permission based security system that is ill equipt to deal with many forms of malware, especially Info Theft Malware. To better understand the issue, we introduce the concept of the User-App Agreement - a framework for a user consenting and trusting specific actions an app may take. Using this concept, we examine the Android Permission system with Android Census - a comprehensive app metadata database - and conclude the main pitfall lies in the Permission system's lack of addressing context and use. Finally, we present AndroMEDA, an Android Security Extension which helps provide an understanding of context and use of Android Permissions to users, allowing them to make better judgment over whether actions are trusted or not. We demonstrate how this can be used to mitigate sophisticated Info Theft Malware.

\chapter*{Acknowledgments}

I would like to express my most sincere gratitude towards my advisor Roy H. Campbell for his continuous guidance and support of my work, as well as Lynette Lubben for her patience. Roy and Lynette opened many doors for my research, and I could not be more appreciative.

I cannot find the words to express my gratitude towards Alejandro Gutierrez for his tireless support and assistance, and unwavering confidence and dedication. My research would not be what it is today without his contributions and mentorship. %The man's dedication is severely underappreciated, and I hope he sleeps sometime. 

%I need to thank the department but I'm not sure

%TODO:
% X  Add GPStore images
% X  Put GPSTORE reference in background
% X  put GPStore permission image in permissions
% X  put in footnote about Android 4.2 READ_STORAGE
% X  Expand on permission rejection in Permissions
% X  Find official source for improving rootkit protection, cite that later.
% X  Show some examples of SMS Trojan - FakeInst
% ?X Put in paragraph about our own malware dataset
% X  Make related works go Project, Shortcomings, Project SHortcomings, etc.
% X  Cite all security extensions in Architecture
%    Make goals of architecture a bullet list
% X  Include companion app in architecutre overview figure
% Talk more about market dataset.
% X  Include appendix of all permissions - just copypaste the spreadsheet, and reference it when we start talking about permissions
% X  Further talk about outliers in the GPStore thingie that personalization
%      https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.livewallpaper.livewallpaper.jjhearts
%      https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fede.launcher
%      https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=wave.live.jwallpapers
% X  Reference the GPStore image in the marketanalysis when talking about popular apps
% X  Generate table of malware dataset and target SDKs, and use to talk about why it's useless.
% Use examples from UAA, turn them into malware, and demonstrate how easy it is to spot.
% conclusion: lack of malware dataset to test on. need to do usability studies.

% RESPONSES TO TODO
% Should we save the market pages above for future reference?




% ADD CONTRIBUTIONS To intro
% PUT IN conclusion how we proved contributions
% Merge 2.2 Malware and 2.2.1 Mobile Malware?
% Keep tense the same. PROOF READ. (especially chapter 3 intro)
% Cite numbers for 4.2 - monetery aservice attack
% Cite someone talking about the three main categories of malware
% Further discuss project shortcomings - It can't detect TapLogger.
% Just more statistics. maybe a table for chapter 4?
% Summary of related works into a table
% Do actual statistics? gah that'd be so hard. (Conclusion when we talk about malware fingerprints being easy to see)
% Contributions: providing a knowledge base of odd behavior
